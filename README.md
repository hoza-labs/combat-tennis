# Combat Tennis

This project preserves a [website] that presents a paddleball game with a twist: you can use amunition to break your opponent's paddle in half, split the ball in two, and more. This is a simple javascript (web-browser) game. It is light-weight and can be saved for offline play.

This game was originally called "Super Pong", but we felt that name might make people think that this game is somehow endorsed by Atari, who made [Pong], or any other company. It is not! It is perhaps also worth noting that this game was written without any knowledge of the awesome [short film "Combat Tennis"], which, according to [imdb], was released in 2011 (after this game was written). We discovered that film after deciding on the new name of this game.

## ORIGIN / CREDITS / BLAME

The game was thrown together in 2009 by the following teenagers, to increase the fun times and happiness in the world:

- Programming: William Hoza
- Game Idea: Cheyenne Hoza
- Testing: Kathleen Hoza

## STATUS

The game worked flawlessly in 2009, but needs attention to make it load and run in today's browsers. Perhaps it would even be best to rewrite it from scratch.
