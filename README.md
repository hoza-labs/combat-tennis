# Combat Tennis

This project preserves a [website] that presents a paddleball game with a twist: you can use amunition to break your opponent's paddle in half, split the ball in two, and more. This is a simple javascript (web-browser) game. It is light-weight and can be saved for offline play.

This game was originally called "Super Pong", but we felt that name might make people think that this game is somehow endorsed by Atari, who made [Pong], or any other company. It is not! It is perhaps also worth noting that this game was written without any knowledge of the awesome [short film "Combat Tennis"], which, according to [imdb], was released in 2011 (after this game was written). We discovered that film after deciding on the new name of this game.

## ORIGIN / CREDITS / BLAME

The game was thrown together in 2009 by the following teenagers, to increase the fun times and happiness in the world:

- Programming: William Hoza
- Game Idea: Cheyenne Hoza
- Testing: Kathleen Hoza

## STATUS 🎉

It's working again, as of December 2025!

- The original flash-based sound solution was the only problem found. We replaced that with a homegrown [fxplayer.js], which uses the modern AudioContext object to play the sounds.
- There are no other known issues. ...except perhaps that it would be best to rewrite this thing from scratch 🙂
- If you run into an issue, please [start a discussion] or [submit a proposed change].
